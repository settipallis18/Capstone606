# Prediction of Intensity of Earthquakes



## Let's Take a look at the dataframe: 
Each of the column of the dataframe and decide which of the columns we don't require for the analysis.

From the dataframe let's take into notice, the references by the columns.

Serial Number:	Column Header:	Refernce by the column
01.	time	Time of the earthquake event
02.	latitude	Latitude of the recorded event
03.	longitude	Longitude of the recorde event
04.	depth	The depth where the earthquake begins to rupture
05.	mag	Magnitude of the event recorded.
06.	magType	The method or algorithm used to calculate the preferred magnitude for the event
07.	nst	The total number of seismic stations used to determine earthquake location
08.	gap	The largest azimuthal gap between azimuthally adjacent stations (in degrees)
09.	rms	The root-mean-square (RMS) travel time residual, in sec, using all weights
10.	id	A unique identifier for the event.
11.	updated	Time when the event was most recently updated.
12.	place	Textual description of named geographic region near to the event.
13.	type	Type of the incident recorded.
14.	horizontalError	Uncertainty of reported location of the event in kilometers
15.	depthError	Uncertainty of reported depth of the event in kilometers
16.	magError	Uncertainty of reported magnitude of the event
17.	magNst	The total number of seismic stations used to calculate the magnitude for this earthquake
18.	status	Status of the recorded event.
19.	dmin	Horizontal distance from the epicenter to the nearest station (in degrees)
20.	locationSource	The network that originally authored the reported location of this event
21.	magSource	The network that originally authored the reported magnitude of the event.
